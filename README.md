NodeJSCatchPhrase
=================

A catch phrase app that runs on a Node.js server. Makes use of socket.io and express.js.

**Note:** This is something I built in about 2 days and was my first app made with sockets. There are many things that the user can do to crash the server. Feel free to fork this and fix the bugs or add features. Thanks!
